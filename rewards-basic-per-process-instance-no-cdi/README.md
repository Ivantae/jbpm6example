rewards-basic-per-process-instance-no-cdi
=============

This version of rewards-basic is developed as an example of direct jBPM API use rather than jBPM EJB/CDI services
 in order to investigate jBPM API in a web application easier (mostly for debug purpose).
 
If you need a basic example, please refer to https://github.com/jsvitak/jbpm-6-examples
